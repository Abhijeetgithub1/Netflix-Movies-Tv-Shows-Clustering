# Unsupervised-ML-project-Clustering
NETFLIX MOVIES AND TV SHOWS  CLUSTERING
This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019.
The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine. • In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on
Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming service’s number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. 
It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset
In this project, you are required to do
1.Exploratory Data Analysis
2.Understanding what type content is available in different countries
3.Is Netflix has increasingly focusing on TV rather than movies in recent years.
4.Clustering similar content by matching text-based features
Conclusion
We have two types of content TV shows and Movies (30.9% contains TV shows and 69.1% contains Movies).
Most films were released in the years 2018, 2019, and 2020 and united states have the maximum content on Netflix.
The months of October, November, December and January had the largest number of films and Tv-shows released.
The USA, India, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Egypt are the top five producer countries.
For the clustering algorithm, we utilized type, director, nation, released year, genre, and year.
Applied different clustering models Kmeans, hierarchical, Agglomerative clustering on data we got the best cluster arrangements.
We cut vertical lines with a horizontal line to obtain the number of clusters in Agglomerative Clustering. There were
four clusters, with an average silhouette score of 0.17296314851287742.
The final model we used was k-means clustering, which consisted of 2,3,4,5,6 clusters. 4 numbers of clusters gives us good fitting.
After applying K - means optimal value of number of clusters is 5
